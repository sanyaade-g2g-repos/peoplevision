# CYA: People Vision Software #

**CYA People Vision Software is a cross platform set of video sensing tools developed in Openframeworks (http://www.openframeworks.cc) for use in design, prototyping, and installed systems.**

A collaboration started by LAB at Rockwell Group (http://lab.rockwellgroup.com ) and the LABS at IDEO (http://labs.ideo.com). Join Us!

This started as an initiative between Dave Vondle and Joshua Walton with many of the key components generated through the hard work of James Tichenor, Brett Renfer, and James George who in turn also used components from the openframeworks community who in turn built upon many open source projects.

Dave Vondle - Project Lead
Joshua Walton - Project Lead
James Tichenor - Interaction Designer
Brett Renfer - Interaction Designer, Software Design and Architecture
James George - Software Design and Architecture

It stands on the shoulders of giants, with special thanks to the teams that develop Openframeworks, OpenCV, and the many individuals who are all working on creating better computer vision systems.

p.s. - We know CYA stands for something, we just aren't sure what.
